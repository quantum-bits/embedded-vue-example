# Embedded Vue Example

## Set Up
1. Run `yarn` to install local HTTP server.
1. Run `yarn serve` to run server.
1. Navigate to one of the URLs shown.
   
# Notes
1. The server doesn't know anything about handling
   `POST` requests, so open Network tab on browser
   tools to see form request being posted.
1. As usual, Vue debugger in browser is helpful
   to see run-time component structure and data
   bindings.
